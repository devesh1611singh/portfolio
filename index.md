## About Me

I’m a Ph.D. researcher at the [German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)](https://www.dzne.de/en/) in Rostock, working within the [Clinical Dementia Research Group](https://www.dzne.de/en/research/research-areas/clinical-research/research-groups/teipel/research-areasfocus/) under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Stefan Teipel and [Dr. Martin Dyrba](https://explaination.net/). In 2022, I graduated with an M.Sc. in Data and Knowledge Engineering from [Otto von Guericke University (OvGU), Magdeburg](https://www.ovgu.de/unimagdeburg/en/), where I specialized in deep learning and computer vision.

My research focuses on building explainable AI models for disease detection using brain MRI data. I’m particularly interested in making deep learning systems more interpretable and clinically useful. One of my projects focused on developing self-supervised learning methods for analyzing brain scans and evaluating how well these models capture imaging features sensitive to neurodegenerative diseases. I’ve also worked on a semantic learning task where an ontology-based framework helped organize and visualize brain atrophy patterns, learning hierarchical rule-based features to make complex pathologic information more accessible. Currently, I’m co-supervising a Master’s thesis investigating a hybrid explainability approach combining rule-based reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate clear, clinically relevant explanations from MRI-derived metrics. At [University Medical Centre Rostock (UMR)](https://www.med.uni-rostock.de/en/), I recently began supporting the implementation of the [Open Medical Inference (OMI)](https://omi.ikim.nrw/) platform to enable peer-to-peer exchange of healthcare data and access to remote AI services. Outside of academia, I’ve had the opportunity to work with STIHL, SMA Solar Technology, and SICK in student roles, where I applied AI to real-world problems. All these experiences continue to shape my passion for building AI tools that are not only technically robust but also practically impactful.
